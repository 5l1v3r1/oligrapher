The rest is history as Goldhar soon became Walmart\'s de facto exclusive developer in the country, literally paving the way for Walmart as it moved into the market. Goldhar is still developing his Walmart-anchored SmartCentres, many of which he then sells to Calloway, a real estate investment trust in which he holds a 22% stake. He manages the parallel operations out of SmartCentres headquarters, known as "the Igloo," in Vaughn, Ontario.',

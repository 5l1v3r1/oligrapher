The rest is history as Goldhar soon became Walmart\'s de facto exclusive developer in the country, literally paving the way for Walmart as it moved into the market. Goldhar is still developing his Walmart-anchored SmartCentres, many of which he then sells to Calloway, a real estate investment trust in which he holds a 22% stake. He manages the parallel operations out of SmartCentres headquarters, known as "the Igloo," in Vaughn, Ontario.',

Over the past 17 years, San Franciscoâs South of Market neighborhood has grown up around the museum: new hotels, retail, restaurants, and residential properties were built and continue to thrive, all contributing to the tax base and economic vitality of the city. In 2016, SFMOMAâs new home will again transform the neighborhood as a major tourist attraction and as an employer: upon completion of the expansion, SFMOMA anticipates an over 20 percent increase in number of employees, as well as a 20 percent growth in its audiences, which averaged 650,000 annually in the years leading up to the museumâs temporary building closure for construction. The expansion will create more than 1,400 new jobs in construction and related areas, and SFMOMA will be an even greater economic stimulant when it expands its operations and purchases of goods and services from Bay Area businesses.\r\n\r\nTo date, SFMOMA has raised more than $570 million toward its $610 million capital campaign goalâa total that includes funds for both construction and endowment.',
